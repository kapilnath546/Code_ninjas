How It Works 
The tax calculation follows these rules:

If your total income (Gross Income + Extra Income - Deductions) is 8 lakhs or less, you donâ€™t have to pay any tax.

Example: If your total income after deductions is 6 lakhs, there is no tax.
If your total income after deductions is 9 lakhs, tax will be applied to the amount over 8 lakhs.
If your income exceeds 8 lakhs, the extra amount is taxed as follows:

30% for individuals under 40 years old
40% for individuals aged 40 to 59 years
10% for individuals 60 years and older
ðŸ”¹ Example Calculation:
For a 34-year-old with an income of 40 lakhs and no deductions, the taxable portion is:
40 - 8 = 32 lakhs
Tax: 30% of 32 lakhs = 9.6 lakhs
